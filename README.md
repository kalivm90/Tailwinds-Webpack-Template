# Tailwinds/Webpack Template

## Why
As someone not very familiar with webpack it can be a pain just getting basic assets to work as intended. I am not sure why but bundling Tailwinds with webpack took me a lot longer than I would like to admit so I am just going to make it into a repo so I never have to deal with this again.

## Extras
I inlcuded how to use images in both your template using img tags and within your JS files. NOTE: I am leaving the compiled files within the project just in case.

## How To Use
clone this repo into a folder and type this into the command line:

```$ npm install``

this will download all of the packages required which you can check in the package.json file
